# GBA_Chess_Engine

## Brief Summary
A Chess engine written entirely by me (yes, even the static library in root/lib!
You can find the source code for it at this [repo](https://github.com/bsumner2/GBA_Dev)!)

## Game So Far

After months of incremental bursts of progress, I finally have completed a bulk
of the game:
- Title screen two choose between gameplay modes
- Gameplay
    - Local two Payer (Person x Person)
    - Singleplayer
        - Person x CPU
        - CPU x person
- (White|Black) Victory Screen & Stalemate Screen
- Loopability of gameplay
- Analysis of Engine's Choices (requires recompilation with predefs, which
  listed below):
